Thank you for viewing the English translation patch for the Soul Eater NDS game, created by the Anime Game Translations Team!

Before you can play the translation, you'll need to patch the game on your computer using a legal copy of the ROM.

===
Instructions

-Extract files from the 'MedusaPatch.zip'
-Download xdelta UI from http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/598/
-Extract the .rar with WinRAR or 7-Zip.
-Run 'xdeltaUI'(not the file simply named 'xdelta')
-For 'patch', choose the 'MedusaPatch.xdelta' file.
-'Source' should be your copy of the ROM, as an '.nds' filetype.
-Finally, set your output destination.
-IMPORTANT Give the output file any name you'd like, but be sure to add '.nds' to the end, or it will not work e.g. 'MedusaPatched.nds'
-Hit patch, and you're good to go!

Play this file on an emulator such as DeSmuME, or use a flashcart to play it on any member of the NDS family.

We hope you enjoy!

***NOTE: ROM DUMP COMPATIBILITY***
This patch is designed to work with a 100% correctly dumped ROM (CRC: 151439BC).
If your ROM is a bad dump (CRC: 632A6D55), you can apply the "bad_to_good.xdelta" patch BEFORE applying the translation patch by following the guide above.

Extra Content

To accompany the patch, we've made released additional resources such as translated cheats, videos and a walkthrough! Check them out on Envy's tumblr: https://envyplays.tumblr.com/post/618720518444646400

Emulation Notes

If playing this game on an emulator, you may notice an issue where certain images are obstructed by a solid pink color. This is an emulator bug which happens even with the unpatched game, but does not happen on real hardware. We recommend updating to the latest build of DeSmuME.
